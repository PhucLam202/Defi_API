# pool-entry-flow

## Tech Stack:
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Frontend: React.js (admin panel optional)
- Authentication: JWT
- Deployment: Docker (optional)

## User Flow:
1. User can submit up to 3 Requests per Pool
2. Requests must be approved and paid before becoming Entries
3. Each user can have up to 3 Entries (numbered 1, 2, 3)
4. Picks made per Entry, updatable until game deadline

## Scoring Logic:
- Win → Entry continues
- Loss → Entry eliminated
- Entries ranked per Pool

## Admin Rules:
- Admin approves/rejects Requests
- On approval + payment → convert to Entry
- Track Request status: pending → approved → entry_created

## Implementation Notes:
- Use JWT auth
- Enforce RESTful API practices
- Input validation, error handling
